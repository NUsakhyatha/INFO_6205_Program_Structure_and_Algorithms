        "A mobile game randomly and uniformly awards a set of k special coins for completing each level. There are n different types of coins. Assuming all levels are equally likely to award each set of coins, how many levels must you complete before you expect to have at least one set of coins that contains all n types of coins?\n",

        "The proof of correctness is similar to the proof of correctness for the coupon collector problem. We can use induction to show that the expected number of levels required to collect at least one set of coins that contains all n types of coins is given by nH(n) * k.\n",

        "Base case:\n",
        "\n",
        "When n = 1, we only need to collect one type of coin. The expected number of levels required to do this is simply k, since each level has an equal probability of awarding any set of coins.\n",

        "\n",
        "Assume that the expected number of levels required to collect at least one set of coins that contains all n - 1 types of coins is given by (n - 1)H(n - 1) * k.

        "Case 1: We collect a set of coins that contains all n types of coins in the first k levels. The probability of this happening is k/n^k. In this case, the expected number of levels required is simply k.\n",
        "Case 2: We do not collect a set of coins that contains all n types of coins in the first k levels. In this case, we can use the inductive hypothesis to say that the expected number of levels required to collect at least one set of coins that contains all n types of coins is given by (n - 1)H(n - 1) * k.\n",
